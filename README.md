Worrying about today's temperature at your place? Well you can now check the temperature of the locations available on our interactive web map.


This project uses Django, PostGIS, and LeafletJS to present the geolocations of the stored places in postGIS DB using leaflet on frontend. 
The project uses API from "https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api" to GET the weather data of the locations based on their geometric locations(Latitude and Longitude).
